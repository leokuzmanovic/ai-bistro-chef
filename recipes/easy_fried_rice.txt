Recipe Tips:
If you don't have any leftover cooked rice, here's how to make it: Combine 4 cups of water and 2 cups of white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, then cover and simmer until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. For the best fried rice results, cover and refrigerate the rice for 8 hours (or overnight) before using in this recipe.
